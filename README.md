## Trello Description
Trello is an app in which you can manage projects and tasks using a kanban board. A board contains lists and tasks. Usually each project is a board, and the lists and cards are the tasks and subjects to do in the project. Users can modify the board and change list and card locations using Drag and Drop.
Users can work together and watch live changes. 
There are many other features in Trello, such as labels, due date for tasks, members and more. 
Every thing Trello has, we also had.

## Application Features
- Create ***Boards*** and manage projects: Using ***D&D***, create, remove, and update lists and tasks.
- Create, edit and archive ***Task*** to the deepest level: Labels, Due date, Members, Cover images, Checklists, Activity log, Copy, Move and Archive.
- ***Side Menu:*** - Change the background of the board, ***Activity*** Log!
- Google Login, along with regular authentication which is encrypted and safe.

In addition, we created adjust color Mode to the Header, the header color adjusts itself by the colors of the backgroung image of the board!

## Technologies

The technology stack we used was MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.
The app uses webSockets to update the board in real-time.
The API calls to the backend are done with the REST API method , and we used middlewares to authenticate and authorize actions.

We have used many thirs side libraries for many goals, such as the color adjest, google-login, D&D and more.
The layout and pixel-perfect were made with Sass (functions, mixins, variables).

### Some mobile!
Just a taste of the mobile experience. We used different **mixins**, **conditional rendering**, and the **"mobile first"** approach. 
The layout we have built from the very first moment enabled us to make the website responsive without a lot of effort.
